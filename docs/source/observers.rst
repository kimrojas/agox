.. _My target:
Observers
================================

The AGOX code relies on an observer-pattern coding scheme to enable the code to be adaptive to new ideas. In fact the 
main function that a normal run is started by just starts an iterative call to the observers of the AGOX object. 

Observers in general 
--------------------

An attempt at illustrating observers is shown in the figure below. In the top row two subprograms are called sequentially, 
in the second row we have a similar situation, however the second program calls an observer. In this example there is not 
really a difference between this and sequentially calling the three programs :math:`P_1, \ P_2, \ O_1`. The key difference 
is that with observers is that :math:`O_1` is not hardcoded to follow :math:`P_2` so the code skeleton enables both 
overall programs and in fact it allows any sequence of subprograms.

Observers to AGOX
-----------------
The 'highest level' of observers in the AGOX code are those to that are observers to the AGOX object. 
The main loop, the one that runs over episodes, of the search function is in the AGOX class of main_agox.py written 
as such

.. literalinclude:: ../../agox/main.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 91-99

The output of a run will include a description of what is actually going on in this loop that looks something like this::

    |=================================== Observers ===================================|
    |  Order 1 - Name: SamplerKMeans.setup                                            |
    |  Order 2 - Name: TimeDependantCollector.generate_candidates                     |
    |  Order 3.0 - Name: IO_relax.postprocess_candidates                              |
    |  Order 4 - Name: LCBAcquisitor.prioritize_candidates                            |
    |  Order 5 - Name: EnergyEvaluator.evaluate_candidates                            |
    |  Order 6 - Name: Database.store_in_database                                     |
    |=================================================================================|

This tells us about the order in which the observers are called, and we can understand the overall behaviour of the algorithm 
in each iteration. First the sampler is updated, then the collector calls the generators to make new candidates. 
These candidates are relaxed using a postprocessor before a lower-confidence-bound acquisitor picks the most promising one. 
The selected candidate is passed on to the energy evaluator and finally the evaluated the candidate is added to the database. 


We may alter this behaviour from the runscript without any changes to the existing code, as an example we can attach 
an additional observer

.. literalinclude:: ../../agox/modules/helpers/helper_observers/episode_timer.py
    :language: python

This defines a very small class that has three methods that are interesting for us, namely the 'start_timer', 'end_timer' 
and 'attach' functions (attach being a required function!). We can use this class like this 

.. code-block:: python 

    timer = Timer()

    agox = AGOX(environment=environment, db=database, collector=collector, sampler=sampler, 
            acquisitor=acquisitor, seed=run_idx, timer=timer)

    agox.run(N_episodes=NUM_EPISODES)

Note that we just pass the 'timer'-object to the AGOX class, and in fact we can parse using arbitary keyword argument! 
The AGOX class will interpret all kwargs as observers and attempt to attach them using their 'attach'-functions. 
The base-classes of most modules have this function defined already, e.g. it is not necessary to rewrite it to 
try a new postprocessor! 

The description that the program outputs will now look like this::

    |=================================== Observers ===================================|
    |  Order 0 - Name: start_timer                                                    |
    |  Order 1 - Name: SamplerKMeans.setup                                            |
    |  Order 2 - Name: TimeDependantCollector.generate_candidates                     |
    |  Order 3.0 - Name: IO_relax.postprocess_candidates                              |
    |  Order 4 - Name: LCBAcquisitor.prioritize_candidates                            |
    |  Order 5 - Name: EnergyEvaluator.evaluate_candidates                            |
    |  Order 6 - Name: Database.store_in_database                                     |
    |  Order 10 - Name: finish_timer                                                  |
    |=================================================================================|

And at the end of each episode it will print something like this:: 

    Time: 64.62845606356859

We can change the order of the 'finish_timer' method to time different parts of the program, e.g. if we set it to 2.5 it will 
time the setup of the sampler and the generation of candidates and the output will change to::

    |=================================== Observers ===================================|
    |  Order 0 - Name: start_timer                                                    |
    |  Order 1 - Name: SamplerKMeans.setup                                            |
    |  Order 2 - Name: TimeDependantCollector.generate_candidates                     |
    |  Order 2.5 - Name: finish_timer                                                 |
    |  Order 3.0 - Name: IO_relax.postprocess_candidates                              |
    |  Order 4 - Name: LCBAcquisitor.prioritize_candidates                            |
    |  Order 5 - Name: EnergyEvaluator.evaluate_candidates                            |
    |  Order 6 - Name: Database.store_in_database                                     |
    |=================================================================================|

So we have added functionality without making any changes to any of the already defined modules of the code, in this case 
it is a somewhat trivial addition, but the underlying principle is very powerful!

Sharing data between observers
-------------------------------

The previous example is simple enough that data is not shared between the Timer-observer and any of the other observers, 
but that is not generally the case. The AGOX class holds a dict that the observers can communicate through, using designated
methods. 

.. literalinclude:: ../../agox/observer_handler.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 238-244

These functions are somewhat opague, and as is evident much of it is handled by 'main_add_to_cache' and 'main_get_from_cache'
which are methods defined on the AGOX class. However this ensures that we can keep track of what each observers wants to 
read or write from the cache. To understand how it works we can look at an example 

.. literalinclude:: ../../agox/modules/helpers/helper_observers/test_io_observer.py 
    :language: python
    :lines: 3-20

The initialization function just passes some arguments to its parent-class Observer, 'gets' and 'sets' are dictionaries 
that control how the observers access the cache. The keys become the names of attributes of the class-object with values 
becoming the values of the attribute. We can attach this observer in the same way as with the Timer and we will now get a 
report that looks like this:: 

    |=================================== Observers ===================================|
    |  Order 1 - Name: SamplerKMeans.setup                                            |
    |  Order 2 - Name: TimeDependantCollector.generate_candidates                     |
    |  Order 2.5 - Name: ObserverWithIOio_method                                      |
    |  Order 3.0 - Name: IO_relax.postprocess_candidates                              |
    |  Order 4 - Name: LCBAcquisitor.prioritize_candidates                            |
    |  Order 5 - Name: EnergyEvaluator.evaluate_candidates                            |
    |  Order 6 - Name: Database.store_in_database                                     |
    |=================================================================================|

.. note:: 

    The 'main_add_to_cache' function expects a list-object! The items in the list can be of any type, but 
    what is passed has to be a list! If in append mode (mode='a') the passed list will be appended 
    to the existing list if it exists and if not a new list will be created. In write mode (mode='w') the 
    entry is always overwritten!

To clarify, the 'method_that_looks_candidates'-method calls 'main_get_from_cache' using 'self.key_name' which resolves 
to 'candidates'. Something has been added with that key by the collector, if the key did not match anything in the episode 
cache the program would fail. The program also prints a report about which observers get/set, in this case it looks like 
so::

    |=========================== Observers set/get reports ===========================|
    |  SamplerKMeans                                                                  |
    |      Doesnt set/get anything                                                    |
    |  TimeDependantCollector                                                         |
    |      Sets 'candidates'                                                          |

    |  Database                                                                       |
    |      Gets 'evaluated_candidates'                                                |
    |                                                                                 |

    |  May cause unintended behaviour!                                                |
    |  Umatched keys ['seen_candidates']                                              |
    |=================================================================================|

We can see that the collector sets 'candidates', our new module reads them and sets 'seen_candidates' but no other 
modules access these! This will not generally break the program, but is probably unintended! 

If we want to change which modules are parsing data to each other we can do so without, see e.g. the basin-hopping script 
for an example. In general it requires the 'gets' and 'sets' dictionaries, this requires the use of the proper attribute names, to 
see the attribute names that the modules are using we can get a more detailed report: 

.. code-block:: python 

    agox = AGOX(...)

    agox.observer_reports(report_key=True)

In which case the report will also print the attribute name, as for example:: 

    |  ObserverWithIO                                                                 |
    |      Gets 'candidates' using key attribute 'key_name'                           |
    |      Sets 'seen_candidates' using key attribute 'set_name'                      |

Thus data can be redirected through modules in any chronological way, that is any way that the order 
of execution, by setting these appropriately!

.. note:: 

    The dictionary that underpins the data sharing is reset in each episode!
