GOFEE + Complementary Energy
==============

Example of using a more advanced generator in a GOFEE search. 

Here a `ComplementaryEnergy` generator, which defines a simple 
energy landscape based on local motiffs is used to generate high quality 
candidates. 

It offers a high degree of customization, with options for choosing: 
* The descriptor 
* The energy function
* How attractors are chosen

If the customization options are not required a class-method is provided to 
create a default `ComplementaryEnergy` generator.
